# Libft

Hey there! Welcome to Libft, my very first programming project at 42 School. This project involves creating a custom library of essential C functions, which means diving into the basics of C programming, memory management, and function implementation. 

## Project Overview

Libft is designed to re-create standard C library functions and add a few extras. Since this is my first project, the code might not be perfect—or even close! I’ve kept it exactly as it was from the start to track my progress and see how my skills develop over time. It’s a snapshot of my learning journey in C programming.

## Features

- **String Manipulation**: Functions for string copying, concatenation, comparison, and length calculation.
- **Memory Management**: Functions for memory allocation, initialization, and clearing.
- **Character Checks**: Implementations of character classification functions like `isalpha`, `isdigit`, etc.
- **Additional Utilities**: Some extra helper functions as required by the project guidelines.

## Usage

You can compile this library and link it to other C projects. Just run `make` to compile and generate `libft.a`, which can be used to add these functions to your own projects.

## Compilation

To compile the library, run:
```bash
make
```

This will create the `libft.a` static library, ready for use in other C projects.

Feel free to explore the code—it’s a work in progress and an early milestone in my programming journey!

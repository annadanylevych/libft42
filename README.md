Libft

Libft is a foundational project at 42 School designed to create a custom C library, implementing a selection of standard C library functions and some additional utility functions. This project aims to build a deeper understanding of C programming fundamentals, memory management, and function implementation.

Project Overview

Libft serves as an introductory project in the 42 curriculum, focusing on recreating essential C functions. This library includes commonly used functions from <string.h>, <stdlib.h>, and other standard headers, providing custom implementations to reinforce core programming concepts.

Features

String Manipulation: Functions for string copying, concatenation, comparison, and length calculation.
Memory Management: Functions for memory allocation, initialization, and clearing.
Character Checks: Implementations of character classification functions like isalpha, isdigit, and similar.
Additional Utilities: Extra helper functions as specified by the project requirements.

Usage

This library can be compiled and included in other C projects to extend functionality. Simply compile using make and link the resulting libft.a archive in your C projects.
